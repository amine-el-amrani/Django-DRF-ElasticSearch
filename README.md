When you start Elasticsearch for the first time, the generated elastic user password and Kibana enrollment token are output to the terminal. Copy the generated password and enrollment token and save them in a secure location. These values are shown only when you start Elasticsearch for the first time. Youâ€™ll use these to enroll Kibana with your Elasticsearch cluster and log in.
